				<h3>Anonymous Functions</h3>
				<p>An anonymous function is a function that was declared without any named identifier to refer to it. As
					such, an anonymous function is usually not accessible after its initial creation.</p>
				<p>
					One common use for anonymous functions is as arguments to other functions.

				<h3>Modules</h3>
				<p>JavaScript programs started off pretty small â€” most of its usage in the early days was to do isolated
					scripting tasks, providing a bit of interactivity to your web pages, so large scripts
					were generally not needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fast forward a few years and we now have complete applications being run
					in browsers with a lot of JavaScript code. Be it for frontend or backend.
					Now it makes sense to start thinking about mechanisms for
					splitting JavaScript programs up into separate modules that can be imported when needed.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					JS modules rely on the <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> statements.
					<br>
					There are two types of exports: Named and Default.
				<ul>
					<li>
						With named, one can have multiple named exports per file.
						<br>
						We import the specific exports we want surrounded in braces.
						<br>
						The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.
					</li>
					<li>
						One can have only one default export per file.
						<br>
						No curly braces are needed in default imports.
						<br>
						The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we
						like.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>

				<h4>Examples</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Importing packages from <a href="https://npmjs.org">npm</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						Import named exports from a <code>person.js</code> :
						<br>
						<code>import { name, age } from "./person.js";</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						Import a default export from <code>message.js</code> :
						<br>
						<code>import message from "./message.js";</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br />
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Events</h3>
				<p class="fragment">
					Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system
					tells you about so your code can react to them.
					<br>
					For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by
					displaying an information box.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Examples</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The user selects, clicks, or hovers the cursor over a certain element.</li>
					<li>The user chooses a key on the keyboard.</li>
					<li>The user resizes or closes the browser window.</li>
					<li>A form is submitted.</li>
					<li>An image is loaded completely.</li>
					<li>A video is played, paused, or finishes.</li>
					<li>An error occurs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Every time such an event occurs, we might want to handle these events so as to perform a specific
					task.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>The recommended mechanism for adding event handlers in web pages is the
					<code>addEventListener()</code> method:</p>
				<p>Changing the <code> background-color</code> of the <code>body</code> to a random color on button
					click.</p>
				<img src="img/generateRandom.png" alt="" class="fragment">
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 style="margin: 0.2em">Promises</h3>
				<p>
					JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they
					have to run one after another. In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff
					that differs from browser to browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as writing markup to the page, updating styles, and
					handling user actions. One thing happening delays the other.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>As a human being, you're multithreaded. You can keep an eye on it Google Meet in your phone , watch
					Valorant videos on your laptop, listen to Spotify, all while eating Nutella. The only blocking
					function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the
					duration of the sneeze.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Now let's bring this closer to development.</h5>
				<br />
				<p>Let's say you want to display an image on your webpage and depending on whether the image has been
					loaded or not you want to perform some tasks.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>This can be achieved by :</p>
				<img src="img/events.png" width="700px" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>It's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work
					around that using the "complete" property of images.</p>
				<img src="img/events2.png" class="fragment" width="500px">
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Issue?</h4>
				<p>
					This doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately the
					DOM doesn't give us a way to do that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of
					images have to be loaded.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Ideal Solution?</h4>
				<img class="fragment" src="img/events3.png" width="700px" />
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Implementation in Real Life?</h4>
				<p class="fragment">This is solved by a ES6 feature known as a <code>Promise</code>.</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					At their most basic, promises are a bit like event listeners except :
				<ul class="fragment">
					<li>A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch
						from success to failure or vice versa.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct
						callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

			</section>

			<section>

				<p>A promise can be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Fulfilled : The action relating to the promise succeeded.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Rejected : The action relating to the promise got rejected.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Pending : Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet.</li>
				</ul>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Syntax</h4>
				<img src="img/promise.png" width="700px" alt="">
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Document Object Model</h3>
				<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif" class="fragment" target="_blank">Visualize</a>
				<p>The Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents. It
					represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM
					represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the
					page. </p>
				<p> DOM can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>can change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
					<li>can change the CSS style of all the elements in the page</li>
					<li>can change the content of all the elements in the page</li>


					<li> can remove existing HTML elements and attributes</li>
					<li>can create new events in the page

					</li>
				</ul>
